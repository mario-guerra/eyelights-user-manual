# Eyelights User Manual

[Eyelights](eyelights.com) is a therapy device designed to help with various neurological conditions. It uses LEDs that emit different colors and blinking patterns to stimulate the brain. This user manual summarizes information on the usage and care of this product.

## Overview

- Hemifield and monocular are the two main blinking patterns.
- Different LED colors and blinking patterns address specific conditions and stimulate different areas of the brain.
- Colored lenses used in conjunction with the LEDs provide additional therapy benefits based on chakra-related effects.

## Hemifield LED Setting

- Relates to brain hemisphericity: Left/left goes 100% to the right brain (blue lights), right/right goes to the left brain (red lights).

## Monocular LED Setting

- Based on the non-dominant eye, useful for treating issues relating to the dominant eye's function.

## Usage

2. Choose the appropriate LED color(s) and blinking pattern(s) to address those conditions. Press the pattern selection button on the device according to the desired sequence of blinking lights, cycling through the 8 settings available.
3. Choose the appropriate color lens to address any additional chakra-related effects.
4. Apply the Eyelights device as needed, following manufacturer guidelines and suggested durations.
5. Adjust the placement, blinking patterns, or LED colors as needed to optimize therapy results.

## Blinking Pattern Sequence

The device offers eight different LED blinking settings, which alternate between the lower and upper rows flashing more brightly:

1. Hemifield Left/Left (each eye) - lower row brighter first
2. Hemifield Left/Left (each eye) - upper row brighter
3. Hemifield Right/Right (each eye) - lower row brighter first
4. Hemifield Right/Right (each eye) - upper row brighter
5. Monocular (all 4 lights on each eye) - lower row brighter first
6. Monocular (all 4 lights on each eye) - upper row brighter
7. Monocular (all 4 lights on each eye) - lower row brighter first; different pattern
8. Monocular (all 4 lights on each eye) - upper row brighter; different pattern

## Additional Recommendations

- Begin patients with 5 minutes of therapy on the non-dominant eye.
- Observe pupillary reflex when lifting the glasses after flashing the lights. If the pupils maintain constriction and it is a consensual reflex, continue to flash the lights until fatigue is observed (from 3 to 36 flashes).
- Therapy can be applied every time there's a commercial while watching TV.
